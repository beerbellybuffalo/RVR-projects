# RVR-projects
Contains the code from the two projects in the RVR review part 2 as seen on https://gethacking.com/blogs/news

Advised to have some basic knowledge of cicrcuits (what is ground, live, current, voltage) before attempting! Google is your best friendðŸ˜€

Note that although I used Serial Communication between the Arduino and RPi, these projects can very much be reproduced with the RPi alone (heed the warning on I/O voltages though)

Happy Hacking!
